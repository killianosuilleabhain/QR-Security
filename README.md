# QR Code Analysis

## Introduction
Within this GitHub repository is my final year project containing the the code, dissertation, research data and other dependancys.

The application is a Flask web application that allows users to generate QR codes for URLs and track their usage. The application provides a simple interface for generating QR codes, which can be easily shared and scanned. It also includes functionality to monitor the usage statistics of generated QR codes.

The research conducted is documented within my dissertation, where I delve into the domain of Cybersecurity and gather data through various research methodologies. Using the Flask application, I collect data during the execution of a social engineering experiment.
